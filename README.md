# Tailwind-vue test project

Firstly I divided all config files for being known where something breaks, in bigger projects, there are many config files for only one kind of configuration (e.g jest or webpack).

Divided small parts of the layout into rendering components, divided actors by folders, a separate folder for the store, routes, views, and components.

Before writing logical functions I wrote tests (TDD) by doing so I wrote general code much faster and kept it as simple as possible.
